# Contests for building Cognits official webpage



## Rules
Fork this repository and upload your implementation of the Cognits webpage. Be sure to
create a new branch called `gh-pages` so the webpage can be viewed publicly.

Judges from Cognits staff will evaluate each project based on the evaluation criteria.

## Evaluation criteria

Each submission will be evaluated in 3 categories:
1. Design and responsiveness: how much the design is like the [sketch](/static/cognits_landing-02.png) and how well it adapts to different types of screens.
2. Follows coding best practices and SEO.
3. Pagespeed Rank.
